# My Blog

[![github pages](https://github.com/appleboy/blog/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/appleboy/blog/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml)

## Running

See the [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for Hugo installation instructions.

To run the site locally when you have Hugo installed:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port `1313`. Open up your browser to `http://localhost:1313` to view the site. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the site and forces a browser refresh.
